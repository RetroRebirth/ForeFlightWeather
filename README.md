## Any notable design decisions you wish to highlight
- The JSON returned from https://qa.foreflight.com/weather/report never contained values for `weather` in my testing. Therefore, I focused the "Details View" on displaying the `text`, `dateIssued`, `lat`, `lon`, and `elevationFt` which was consistently provided.
