## Known issues
- The `weather` array from JSON response of https://qa.foreflight.com/weather/report/ is always empty.
- Auto fetching while in a "More" forecast tab forces the user to an eariler day's forecast upon update.
- It's possible the "Airport Not Found" alert may display the incorrect airport if the user modifies the search text before the network call returns, though I never experienced this issue in my testing.

## Any other notes that will help us understand your project
- This project is my second attempt this time using up-to-date technologies consisting of a 2024 Macbook Pro with iOS 17.4, Xcode 15.3, macOS 14.4, and Swift 5.10.
- The JSON returned from https://qa.foreflight.com/weather/report never contained values for `weather` in my testing. Therefore, I focused the "Details View" on displaying the `text`, `dateIssued`, `lat`, `lon`, and `elevationFt` which was consistently provided.
